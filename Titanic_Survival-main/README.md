# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

In this Project, Firstly I tried to observe and analyse the data through graphs and pivot tables. After completing the E.D.A, I tested several classification models and select the best model based on the performance matrics. Then I convert the jupyter file into a pickle file. Then I created a frontend with the help of HTML and flask framework and deployed the model in HEROKU platform.
